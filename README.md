## Hi!

Welcome to Toronto AI!


### Install stuff
To get started with scikit, you'll need a python 3.6 environment with scikit, jupyter and some other libraries.  You can get all of this in one download <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.  Choose the 3.6 version. There is an installer for windows, mac and linux.


Do you have it installed?  Ok!  The next step is to clone this repository, which contains the example we'll be using.  To clone this repository, open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```git clone https://github.com/toronto-ai/workshops.git```

If you don't have git installed, you can find it <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.  If you're running windows, then after the install, launch 'Git CMD'.  If you're on a Mac, no extra steps are needed.

Now, once you have it cloned, go into that folder and type

```jupyter notebook```

A browser window will open and then navigate to python/scikit/digit-recognition.ipynb.


Cheers,
The Toronto AI team
